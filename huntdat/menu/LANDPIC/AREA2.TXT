Area 2: Basmachee Rocks
Experience: Novice

This map is a good challenge for beginning
hunters. The exact origin of this island remains
a mystery.  Its unique topography of deserts,
mountains, and lakes makes for a challenging
area to hunt in.  High hills can be a great
place to perch in wait, or hide a dinosaur from
sight.
