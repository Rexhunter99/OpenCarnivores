 Carnivores Direct3D patch (beta 1.3) release notes 
----------------------------------------------------
This patch works only with FULL version of Carnivores.
This version of D3D patch was tested and worked well on the following 
chipsets:

 Matrox G200
 Riva 128
 Riva TNT
 ATI 3D Rage Pro
 S3 Savage 3D
 3D Labs Permedia 2

However, if you experience any problems with this patch, please download
and install the latest drivers for your chipset. In most cases this helps.
If you still have technical problems contact oleg@af.kiev.ua

There are three options that influence the rendering process.

1. COLORKEY (COLOR/ALPHA CHANNEL, default setting: Color)
Some of the boards do not support colorkeying; this causes the appearance
of black pixels instead of transparency. If you have this problem, please
set this option to ALPHA CHANNEL mode. Some video boards can support both 
options, but setting this option to a specific mode can enhance rendering 
quality.

We recomend to set ALPHA CHANNEL on Riva TNT based accelerators.

2. TEXTURES (LOW/HIGH/AUTO)
This option defines the size of textures used when rendering. If you have 
a video card with 8+ Megs of VRAM set it to HIGH or AUTO. If you have less
than 6 Megs of VRAM it is recommended to set this option to LOW or AUTO
(this will improve game speed). If you are not sure about the amount of
video memory of your card, set it to AUTO(in this case the game will
set the quality of textures depending on the amount of memory available
and scene complexity).

3. FOG (ON/OFF)
Usually, enabling fog will just decrease performance about 15-20%. But
sometimes enabling or disabling fog can enhance or make worth rendering
quality.
